# An Introduction to Bamazon
Welcome to Bamazon! Please have a look around and shop to your heart's content! 

### How does it work?
Bamazon uses nodeJS. It uses a series of MySQL calls to manage the localhost database, update records, join tables, and calculate additional data in real-time. User input is handled by the Inquirer node package; database calls are handled by the MySQL node package.
